In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive

 of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or IllegalArgumentException (Java) or RangeException (PHP) or throw a RangeError (JavaScript) or ValueError (Python) or return -1 (C).

Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he does, he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum 'P' has
 to be kept in the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'.

The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After paying taxes 'T' for the year the new sum is re-invested.

Note to Tax: not the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest
Example:
  Let P be the Principal = 1000.00      
  Let I be the Interest Rate = 0.05      
  Let T be the Tax Rate = 0.18

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

The split('#') method is called on the url string, which splits the string into an array using the anchor (#) as the delimiter.
 This creates an array with two elements: the portion of the URL before the anchor and the portion after the anchor.
For example, if the url is "www.codewars.com#about", the split('#') method will return ["www.codewars.com", "about"].
The [0] index access is used to retrieve the first element of the resulting array, which represents the portion of the URL before the anchor.
For example, if the url is "www.codewars.com#about", split('#')[0] will return "www.codewars.com".
The retrieved portion of the URL before the anchor is then returned as the result of the function.*/
